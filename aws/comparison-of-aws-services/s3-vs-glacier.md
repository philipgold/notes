- Amazon S3 is a durable, secure, simple, and fast storage service, while Amazon S3 Glacier is used for archiving solutions.
- Use S3 if you need low latency or frequent access to your data. Use S3  Glacier for low storage cost, and you do not require millisecond access  to your data.
- You have three retrieval options when it comes to Glacier, each varying in  the cost and speed it retrieves an object for you. You retrieve data in  milliseconds from S3.
- Both S3 and Glacier are designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones.
