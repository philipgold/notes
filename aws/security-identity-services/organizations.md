# AWS Organizations

- It offers policy-based management for multiple AWS accounts. 

### **Features**

- With Organizations, you can create groups of accounts and then apply policies to those groups.
- Organizations provides you a policy framework for multiple AWS accounts. You can  apply policies to a group of accounts or all the accounts in your  organization.
- AWS Organizations enables you to set up a single payment method for all the AWS accounts in your organization through **consolidated billing**. With consolidated billing, you can see a combined view of charges  incurred by all your accounts, as well as take advantage of pricing  benefits from aggregated usage, such as volume discounts for EC2 and S3.
- AWS Organizations, like many other AWS services, is **eventually consistent**. It achieves high availability by replicating data across multiple servers in AWS data centers within its region.

### **Administrative Actions in Organizations**

- Create an AWS account and add it to your organization, or add an existing AWS account to your organization.
- Organize your AWS accounts into groups called *organizational units* (OUs).
- Organize your OUs into a hierarchy that reflects your company’s structure.
- Centrally manage and attach policies to the entire organization, OUs, or individual AWS accounts.

### **Concepts**

- An **organization** is a collection of AWS accounts that you can organize into a hierarchy and manage centrally.
- A **master account** is the AWS account you use to create your organization. You cannot  change which account in your organization is the master account.
  - From the master account, you can create other accounts in your organization, invite and manage invitations for other accounts to join your  organization, and remove accounts from your organization. 
  - You can also attach policies to entities such as administrative roots,  organizational units (OUs), or accounts within your organization. 
  - The master account has the role of a payer account and is responsible for  paying all charges accrued by the accounts in its organization. 
- A **member account** is an AWS account, other than the master account, that is part of an  organization. A member account can belong to only one organization at a  time. The master account has the responsibilities of a payer account and is responsible for paying all charges that are accrued by the member  accounts.
- An **administrative root** is the starting point for organizing your AWS accounts. The  administrative root is the top-most container in your organization’s  hierarchy. Under this root, you can create OUs to logically group your  accounts and organize these OUs into a hierarchy that best matches your  business needs.
- An **organizational unit** (OU) is a group of AWS accounts within an organization. An OU can also contain other OUs enabling you to create a hierarchy.
- A  **policy** is a “document” with one or more statements that define the controls that you want to apply to a group of AWS accounts.
  - **Service control policy** (SCP) is a policy that specifies the services and actions that users  and roles can use in the accounts that the SCP affects. SCPs are similar to IAM permission policies except that they don’t grant any  permissions. Instead, SCPs are *filters* that allow only the specified services and actions to be used in affected accounts.
