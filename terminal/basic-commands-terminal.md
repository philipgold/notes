# Basic Commands (Terminal)

## Commands for Navigation:
* `pwd` - (path working directory) shows you in what directory you are
* `ls` - (list files in current pwd) this one is probably the most useful one. There are many ways to customize it (with flags), the most common for me might be `ls -lha` which means, list all the files (including the hidden ones) in a column and add info about them (size, etc in human readable form).
* `ls -lhad */` - lists only folders (with all their attributes).
* `cat` - displays/outputs the contents of the file. It is useful for reading a file very quickly, but if the file is long you might want to do `head` or `tail` which only displays the first or last lines of the file.
* `man` - (manual) do `man` and some command to get the manual for that command. Very useful to know the specific flags for certain commands.
* `cd` - change directory. You can also do `cd ...` to move one up or `cd ../..` to move two up (etc).
* `clear` - clears the terminal screen.
* `cd -` - goest to last path.
* `~` - goes to home directory.
* `df -h` - displays free disk space.
* `du -sh` - displays disk usage (the flag `s` is for summarized form).
* `du -sh *` - displays the disk usage for every folder or file in that location.
* To create a text file with the size of folders and subfolders do `du -hd 3 * > 00_File_and_Folder_Size.txt`. The `du` is disk usage, the flag `h` means human readable and the `d 3` means with a depth of 3 (folders), and the `*` means all folders and files there.
* Another option is to do `du -s * | sort -n` which will sort the results based on the size from smallest to largest.
* arrow up or arrow down, brings up the last commands. Space bar to go to next page.
* `history` - View history of commands ran in terminal
    * `rm ~/.bash_history && history -c` - To clear the history, delete the file and clear the temp history

## Commands to manage files and folders
* `mkdir` - makes a directory.
* `touch` - creates a blank file.
* `echo` - prints line (ie. `echo "hello world!"`).
* `>` - appends a line to a file (ie. `echo "hello world!" > text.txt`). **Careful, this command overwrites what's in the file.**
* `>>` - appends to the end of the file (safer).
* `history | less` - history and "pipe", less is a paginator. To get out of this just press `q`.
* `cp` - copy. **Careful, it overwrites.**
* `cp -i` - copy with warning. `-i` means "ask for confirmation".
* `mv` - move **Careful, it overwrites.**
* `rm` - remove **Careful, it destroys.** (ie. `rm -ri` to remove recursive and with warning, for example if you want to remove a directory and its contents.)
** 'rm -r mydir' - To remove a directory that contains other files or directories
* `-i` - ask for confirmation.
* `.` - the dot means here, for example when you are copying something to your current location.
* `locate` - finds a file.
* `srm -rmzv` - secure removes files or folders with `m` medium grade (7 pass DoD compliant), `z` zero data. If you want to avoid the confirmations add the flag `f` (force).
* You can join multiple files with `cat`. For example: `cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > file4.txt`.
* `zip -r foo.zip foo` - zips foo into the foo.zip file.
* `unzip \*.zip` - unzips multiple files.

## Text editor
* `nano` - Nano is one of the text editors. You can open files with `nano file/to/open` and edit them there.

## Downloading files
* `wget` - get something, usually from a site online (ie. `wget http://etc.etc`). Probably need to install the right command through "homebrew".

## Navigating in the Terminal
* 'ctrl+A' - moves to start of line.
* 'ctrl+E' - moves to end of line.
* 'ctrl+B' - moves back one character.
* 'ctrl+F' - moves forward one character.
* 'ctrl+U' - deletes from cursor to start of line.
* 'ctrl+K' - deletes from cursor to end of line.
* 'ctrl+W' - deletes from cursor to beginning of current word.
