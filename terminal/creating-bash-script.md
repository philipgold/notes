# Creating a Bash Script (Terminal)

* Write the script in a text editor (ie. nano) and save it as a .sh file.
* Go to the file location and change the permissions so that the file can be used as an executable: `sudo chmod 700 file.sh`.
* To run the script go to the file location and type `./file.sh`, or from other location just type `location/of/file/file.sh`.
