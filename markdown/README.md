## Converting .md Files to .pdf

* There are multiple ways of doing this. The one that keeps the format closer to 'github flavored markdown' is called [grip](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip).
* Another very popular one is [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/README.html), although it doesn't keep the format as you would see it in github. It seems to be customizable though, but I haven't spent enough time with it.
* My current preferred option is Gitprint, but it only works for markdown documents on Github. Just replace the `github.com` in the URL with `gitprint.com` and it will generate a PDF you can print.
* Finally, another one is called [Gimli](https://github.com/walle/gimli).
